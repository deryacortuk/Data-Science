## Normality Test (Shapiro Test): 
The Shapiro test is used to assess whether data follows a normal distribution. The assumption of normal distribution is important for certain statistical tests to produce accurate results. If the data deviates from normal distribution, non-parametric statistical tests can be used as an alternative.

## Variance Homogeneity Test (Levene Test): 
The Levene test is used to evaluate whether the variances of different groups' data are equal. The assumption of variance homogeneity is crucial in ANOVA and some regression analyses. If significant differences exist among the variances of groups, alternative methods can be employed.

## Hypothesis Test (ANOVA - F Test):
The ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) test is used to determine whether the means of two or more groups are statistically different. 
It is particularly useful for making comparisons among different groups and identifying which groups are distinct from each other.

## Non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis Test:
The Kruskal-Wallis test is a non-parametric test used when the assumptions of normal distribution and variance homogeneity are not met. It is employed to assess whether the distributions of different groups are statistically different.

## Correlation Analysis: 
Correlation analysis is used to evaluate the relationship between two variables. Correlation indicates the degree of association between two variables.

## Correlation Meaning Test (Pearson's Correlation): 
Pearson's correlation coefficient is used to measure the linear relationship between two continuous variables. 
This test is used to assess whether the relationship between two variables is statistically significant.

## Non-parametric Hypothesis Test (Spearman's Correlation, Kendall's Tau): 
If the assumptions of normal distribution and variance homogeneity are not met,
Spearman or Kendall correlation tests can be used instead of Pearson's correlation coefficient. These tests involve ranking the data and are used to 
determine whether the relationship between variables is statistically significant.

These statistical tests are used in various scenarios, such as data analysis, determining differences among groups, and assessing relationships between variables. Especially in research and data analysis, selecting the appropriate statistical tests is crucial for ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the results."
